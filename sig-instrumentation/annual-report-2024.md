# 2024 Annual Report: SIG Instrumentation

## Current initiatives and Project Health

1. What work did the SIG do this year that should be highlighted?

<!--
   Some example items that might be worth highlighting:
   - Major KEP advancement
   - Important initiatives that aren't tracked via KEPs
   - Paying down significant tech debt
   - Governance and leadership changes
-->

- `Contextual Logging` graduated to [beta](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/pull/4219)
- [Usage metrics collector](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/usage-metrics-collector) now supports [cgroupsv2](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/usage-metrics-collector/pull/140)
- Introduced `Component Statusz` [alpha](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/pull/4830)
- Introduced `Component Flags` [alpha](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/pull/4831)
- Final draft ready for `Resource State Metrics` [alpha](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/pull/4811)

2. Are there any areas and/or subprojects that your group needs help with (e.g. fewer than 2 active OWNERS)?

- [kubernetes-sigs/custom-metrics-apiserver](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/custom-metrics-apiserver/blob/master/OWNERS)
- [kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server/blob/master/OWNERS)
- [kubernetes-sigs/prometheus-adapter](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/prometheus-adapter/blob/master/OWNERS_ALIASES)

3. Did you have community-wide updates in 2024 (e.g. KubeCon talks)?

<!--
  Examples include links to email, slides, or recordings.
